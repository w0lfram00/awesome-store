# Camp Project - Awesome-Store
This mobile app is result of 2 week long camp, where i've been following technical documantation and design, while being coordinated by mentore. It fetures React Native, Nest.js, PrismaDB, PostrgeSQL...

Backend utalizes most of main features of Nest.js, so it reads simply and clearly.

Frontend is React Native on Expo. And React-navigation is used for routing.
